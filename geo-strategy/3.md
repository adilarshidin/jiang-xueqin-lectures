# [Geo-Strategy #3: How Empire is Destroying America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_blj8zKdKgA)

1950-1980 US economy were factories: 40% GDP, 40% profits, 30% population employed. During this time working class had the best life in the world.

After Reagan and neoliberalism we live in a financial economy. Financial services 22% GDP of US, manufacturing 10%. Financial services 40% profits, 5% of total workforce.

## Governance

1950-1980 middle class had unions, participated in politics.

Today Wall Street, professional managerial elite are in charge.

So government makes policies that are in favor of the current elite.

## Education

Before the ambition was to be a professor, professional, etc. Now to go into finance.

Smartest people are engaged in speculation, young people don't want to work.

## Economy

Gone from creative and productive to a speculative. Much more unstable. 2001, 2008, after that much more financial crashes. That happens because of bubbles. All assets in US are now overpriced.

Inequality, the top 1% makes multipliers than everyone else and it gets worse.

Creation of rentier. If you are young you can never afford to buy a house, only rent.

By end of cold war US became the global empire and would always win in the game itself creates.

1776 independence from Britain. We are founding a new society based on God. The founding fathers were deists (God exists but is not interested in our affairs). They believed God gave 3 rights to a human everyone should honor: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.

Thomas Jefferson wrote the declaration and by "pursuit of happiness" he meant wealth.

1944 Bretton-Woods conference. Everyone knew that Japan and Germany would be defeated and that US will be the new western power. Here they decided that US dollar becomes global reserve currency, you can buy anything with the US dollar. It had to be backed by gold to avoid misuse of power. So it was a receipt for gold.

1971 Nixon removes gold standard tie. Transitioned to petrodollar. Dollar tied to oil. Middle East aggreed to being able to buy oil with dollars.

1991 USSR destroyed, US focused on trade. Idea was that each country would focus on their competitive advantage and sell to the neighbor, so all the countries would become rich. China makes cheap goods, US has technology. Americans have money to buy chinese goods but chinese don´t have money to buy american technology. So US gives the dollar to them. In theory the dollar goes down the chain to the worker (wages go up) and now he can buy american products. So over time trade evens out. Capital here in theory will go to places which allows it to grow the most. 1 house in US or 10 houses in China you would buy 10 in China for the same price.

It doesn't work because of elite capture. The money passed to  the chinese is captured by the elite. In theory they should invest it to China, but in practice they invest it in US because you put the money where it's the most safe.

That's how everything in US became overpriced. 1900 largest stock market was UK, 25% of global market. US 14,5%. Germany 13%. France 11%. 2024 US 60%, Japan 6%, China 3%.

Wall Street makes money based off how they manage the money they are given, not by how they generate more money. So they design riskier opportunities to attract more wealth, because then they can take a managing fee.

Debt 34 trillion USD. Half is own by foreigners. Half owns to the people: US military and pensions. GDP is 100 trillion. Debt is 1/3 of the GDP. Debt has interest, growing 1-2 trillion every 2-3 months. No way it can be payed of.

Why as China or Japan or others would have all these american debt knowing it can not be repayed? Firstly in theory they can always take the debt and buy oil with it (petrodollar). Secondly US is still the power and the money is still safe there. Thirdly there is no place to go and put money.

US can not go back and reindustrialise to solve the problem because the financial sector has all the power and they don't want to give it up. Also there is a speculative mindset in place, no one will want to work in a factory again.

To solve the problem you can invade Iran. It's politically the easiest to do:

1. You show that you're the best still.
2. Oil. If you control it you don't have to worry about others abandoning dollar.
3. Trade. Most of the world's trade historically has passed through Iran.
